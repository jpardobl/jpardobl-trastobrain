It is developed using a Domain Driven Design aproach and Onion Architecture.


###How to start

First create a Python virtual environment:
```
> virtualenv venv
```

Activate the new virtual environment.
```
> . venv/bin/activate
```

Clone the repo and cd into it
```
git clone git@github.com:jpardobl/jpardobl-trastobrain.git

cd jpardobl-trastobrain
```

Install the project into the virtualenv
```
pip install .
```

Install requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Execute the server from the command line (important to execute it from the base path of the project)
```
scripts/start.sh
```
